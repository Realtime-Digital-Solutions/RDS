                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">The RDS team has been working consistently as a team now for a matter of months. 
<br>
<br>Post submission of assignment 2 there was a short lull in communication and progress amongst the team. I believe this was only due to the tremendous effort by all members thus far and the final push to submit assignment 2 and therefore need a short break to clear the minds and prep for the remainder of the group work.  
<br>
<br>All members have continued to communicate well, and the use of Microsoft Teams and Task assignment has increased and now clearly identifies who is working on what. We continue to struggle for leadership and while I don’t think this comes as a detriment to the quality of our work, we do appear to struggle with direction sometimes often taking considerable time to make collective decisions.  
<br>
<br>The team seem to have learnt from our previous collaboration experience and no see the value in a systematic approach to the assignments. The focus this time around has been largely collating the information, data and content and prioritising this over “making it look pretty”. 
<br>
<br>Overall, I feel we are on a positive trajectory and continue to work effectively as a team.  the areas where we lack as a team could easily be solved with time. All members conduct themselves in a respectful manner.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">The team has demonstrated a positive attitude towards all assessments.  
<br>
<br>After submitting assignment two we took a short break and came back fresh and ready to tackle assignment three and five. We quickly decided on the project idea and all team members participated in this discussion. The delegation of jobs was done by everyone selecting a strength, we felt as though putting the best people in the best positions gives us the best opportunity to score a high grade.  
<br>
<br>The project idea was produced by Shane, and I was surprised by everyone’s enthusiasm to learn and understand the more technical areas. The team were a pleasure to work with and each individual conducted themselves in a respectful manner.  
<br>
<br>I look forward to showing my work colleagues new ways to use Microsoft Teams, hopefully I can take some areas of this course into my practical field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">I personally believe that the group’s efforts in Assignment 2 was incredible and the same goes for Assignment 3. Everyone took charge of their roles and was passionate about the topics. As I recollect from my previous individual reflection, I reiterate that I couldn’t have done it without them. Hence what teamwork is all about. The communication at the beginning of Assignment 3 took a little while to get started. I believe this was due to the time frame in which most of the public holidays lay. However, once we scheduled our Team Meetings, things naturally fell into place.  
<br>
<br>In regard to the website, I eventually had to take charge of building it entirely as we were approaching the due date for submission. The group didn’t know that we had to convert our documents into their web page counterparts, and this would have been easier as we know our own documents well. I am sure I communicated this or it was obvious from Assignment 2 but there could have been a miscommunication. The linking of all these pages together and a clash of ideas played a part as well. I accepted the responsibility to build the website as no one else communicated on what part they were going to do. This led me to work on it all night, into the morning and I had to take the rest of the week off work before submission to get it done. I value my group members, and this is in no way demoralising them, but I must be honest. From a positive standpoint, this was the only way the website could have been built as laying everything across one page would have been tricky and many inputs at the last minute could have been disastrous. My plate was full and with my limited technical knowledge of Python, I couldn’t contribute much to Shane’s Python code and GUI variant, certainly not in the time frame allocated. To improve, I will have to make more effort in committing and setting aside time to self-educate myself. 
<br>
<br>What was surprising was the effort from Shane and his ability to get a prototype up and running in the time frame allocated. The rest of the team working on their documents and completing the tasks was impressive as well as learning about the features, given our basic understanding of the technical side. 
<br>
<br>One thing I have learnt about groups is that communication is a key fundamental in the success of as an outcome. If anyone is struggling, the group must be made aware. If anyone is overwhelmed, the group also must be made aware.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Overall, I am quite happy with what we’ve managed to achieve as a group with varying levels of expertise. We have managed to complete 3 big assignments together, improving and applying feedback with each assignment.  
<br>
<br>That being said, I think our pace slowed towards the end of the unit. Perhaps bi-weekly meetings were becoming too difficult to maintain or we became too comfortable with our communication level after completing assignment 2 with relative ease. Given the opportunity to start assignment 3 and 5 again, I would have jumped straight in after assignment 2, rather than taking a bit of a break in between. Unfortunately, I think this break is what lead us to a stressful submission week for the final assignments.  
<br>
<br>We did, however, show fantastic cohesion when it came to organisation, task-oriented goals, and delegation. The ‘tasks’ feature in MS Teams has proved to be very useful for us and helped us stay on track. I was surprised at how much of an impact this made, and how much visibility this gave us while pulling everything together at the end.  
<br>
<br>I believe we have all gained valuable tools for successful teamwork moving forward, and I’m excited to take what I’ve learnt here into future group assignments.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">It has been a couple of months our team has been collaborating well and we seem to have improved in the communication area. Our assignment 3 and 5 have progressed to a level of completion.  
<br>
<br>In the beginning of assignment 3, we were a little slow to start however, when we did finally build pace, everything coalesced nicely. This was reminiscent of the start of assignment 2. I don’t believe we have learnt from assignment 2 and how important it is to get started on our assignments as soon as possible to avoid the rush when it is due. Overall, I believe the team has performed quite well in assignment 3. 
<br>
<br>There is however, something I found somewhat disappointing. As the Lead Software Developer, I found myself developing every aspect of our project, from writing code to hardware development to GUI development/design to software tools to project idea. This was a considerable amount of work, research to devise a working device and application development. I’m not sure if the other team members understood what I was doing or had any interest in the developmental side of the project. It would have been a surprise if someone in the group had of shown an interest and helped me with the project development. Would have made my job a bit easier.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">It took a week or so to get everyone back on board and we fell behind with assignment progress. I would like to give some positive feedback and say that we all worked well together to complete our group assignments. However, motivation within the team felt lacking compared to our last assignment. I think perhaps the group was a little overwhelmed with the study workload moving towards the end of our study period. Our assignment 5 presentation was pushed to the side while we concentrated on our assignment 3 work. <br><br>Shane and I tried to help get the group back on track but I think the deadline stress may have gotten to everyone. I tried to support the team as much as I could but ran into conflicts with my occupation responsibilities and issues arising that took a lot of my time and energy. I would have liked to have assisted Shane with work on our project artifacts but the learning curve seemed very involved, and I had to prioritise my focus on other areas. In the end, we have managed to produce more than satisfactory work for our assignments. I feel that if the whole team (myself included) were able to be more committed to our group assignments, we could have achieved exceptional results.  </p></blockquote>

                            <strong>Group Reflection</strong></h4>
                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The group committed to meeting twice a week via Microsoft teams, to everyone’s credit we stuck with this commitment and were able to achieve excellent results. Each member selected the piece of work which most suits their skill set, to result in more efficient output and a better outcome for the group. As a group we were surprised yet impressed by each other's support. If an individual felt they had too much of a workload, they would simply reach out to the team (using Microsoft Teams) and others were quick to put their hand up and help.  
<br>
<br>The team made it a priority to check in with Microsoft teams regularly and noted the fast replies as an added benefit and key to our success. When considering each members contribution, you will note that team meetings were frequent, and all members attended where possible. Each member was engaged and provided input and these meetings, whilst contributing towards assessment 3 and 5 in what we all felt was a consistent manner across the board. Looking at improvements, we left it very late to collate our work and submit the final product. This put added pressure on certain individuals and gave us little time to review each other's work. If we had our time over, I’m sure we would have given ourselves a deadline - days prior to the actual due date. 
<br><br>There were times that confusion did arise because of a misunderstand in the layout of the Team Website and the most efficient and presentable way of handling it as there were so many links to account for. The ease of use in navigation of the website had to be considered. I do admit, we left the Team Website too late. Some tasks that were allocated to individuals were interfered with and I believe this could have been due to a worry about the deadline and the speed of the work. There also could have been descension among the group due to unfair workload but this not confirmed. 
<br><br>With the added benefit of working with each other previously, we were assisted by knowing each other's strengths. In a workplace this is taken for granted as often colleagues have worked successfully together for several years. It makes a big difference and is a key stat for management, staff turnover. For many members of this team university was studied part time, meaning it was not our sole focus, we juggled our responsibilities between working full time, caring for family and getting through a pandemic. Given these added responsibilities our team should be commended for their efforts in making themselves approachable and available throughout the assignment. We are committed to achieving a high result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
