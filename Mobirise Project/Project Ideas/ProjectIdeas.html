                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7">In the ever-growing world of Technology, there are always issues to be solved. One of the key factors in the pursuit of success and gaining traction as a business is by solving problems. Problem solving will always be appreciated in the modern world as consumers and businesses are striving to find ways to make their lives easier. This brings us to our Project Idea that we believe will compliment an industry that will travel hand in hand with the future, and that is Health. This device will give Doctors/Nurses/Medical personnel the tools to monitor and analyze their patients using a multitude of technology already available to us. By incorporating these established technologies, we believe that we can assist the Healthcare system and do our part in saving people’s lives.
<br><br>We envision an IoT device that connects to existing Wi-Fi infrastructure. The data is collected from the IoT device which is then reported to a console. The IoT device will be an ESP8266/Arduino Nano 33IoT that connects to a Local Hotspot or Wi-Fi connection, which then will be transmitted via Wi-Fi. The information will be displayed on a GUI (Graphical User Interface) in the form of a Web page, PC application, with smartphone and tablet support in future updates. This device will display the data collected and report the position of the IoT device relative to a Wi-Fi hotspot or a Wi-Fi connection point using RSSI (Receiver Signal Strength Indicator) levels to determine position. GPS would be another alternative for position location however buildings and underground carparks do not always offer GPS signals as well as pose great difficulty. This is also highly costly. The data collected from the IoT device could be heart rate from a patient, GPS position and vital signs. GPS position of a Nurse/Doctor in a hospital or position of vehicle in an underground carpark.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7">The motivation for this project came from the opportunity to work with high level technology. As the Lead Designer of this Project and work experience from my career at MST Global, I found compelling technology in place for their underground tracking systems for their miners and various equipment. I can there are many uses for this technology in other fields of expertise. Backed up by a team of strong individuals with many skills to offer, I believe that Realtime Industries can head this project in the right direction. Healthcare for us is where we will begin our journey. By helping, guiding, and reducing the load on the already congested Healthcare system, we believe that we can do our part to reduce casualties and ensure emergency services can get to patients on time. We are passionate and stand behind our product with the belief that we will be saving hundreds, if not thousands of lives.</p>

                        Description</strong></h2>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7">The IoT heartrate monitor/tracker consists of an IoT device that is battery operated and is worn by the patient. It will use an ESP8266 or an Arduino Nano 33 IoT unit that will monitor the patient’s heartbeat via a sensor that detects light through the skin. This sensor uses infrared to achieve this. The sensor will require 3.3V to 5V for its voltage supply and this will be supported by the Arduino Nano or ESP8266. The IoT device will run from a 9V Alkaline battery or 3.6V lithium-ion battery and the internal regulators will supply the 5V. The communication from the heartbeat sensor to the IoT microcontroller will use I2C Serial Interface. This serial interface will provide the microcontroller with the data from the heartbeat sensor. This data will be analyzed, processed, and then sent out via Wi-Fi (TCP/IP/UDP) to the monitoring software. The MAC address of the IoT device will aid in the individual identification of the device.
<br><br>The Wi-Fi connection on the PC Laptop/Desktop will be receiving the data from the IoT device. The monitoring software will be constantly taking data from the IoT device and displaying the data on its GUI interface as beats per minute (bpm). It will also be monitoring the receiver strength signal (RSSI) of the IoT device to allow it to display an approximate location to the receiving laptop/desktop. This will be displayed on a simple map at first and then progress to something more complex in future developments. The position of the sensor will rely heavily on the Wi-Fi hotspot’s ability to receive quality radio signals. If there are enough Wi-Fi hotspots, a process of triangulation will be employed for the accuracy of location. There will be a maximum and minimum setting for the heartrate data that will produce an alarm if the heartrate is above or below the set limits. This is to alert a Healthcare Professional that the patient is suffering and requires urgent medical attention. The monitoring software will be written in Python 3.x and will use socket programming to interface to the Wi-Fi IoT device. The IoT device will use C/C++ to program its firmware.
<br>
<br>A web page with similar information of patient statistics can also be developed. This web page can be hosted on a local server or cloud and storage of vital data such as time, position, heartrate etc. For future data analysis, development of ethernet network connection to the monitoring software will also be implemented. Development of over the air configuration of the IoT device for quick and easy deployment as the device is changed from one patient to another. This feature will be added to the existing applications and will require special permission such as a password to program the device. Security of the data will also be implemented as to protect the patient’s details and to help eliminate data corruption.&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-7"><strong><em>Tools and Software/Firmware requirements
<br></em></strong><br>There are several software tools, hardware and programming languages that are required for our IoT project.  
<br> Our primary goal: 
<br>•	Develop an application in Python
<br>•	Develop an IoT device to monitor patient vital signs
<br>•	Display the data from the IoT device on the PC application
<br>•	Use Wi-Fi hotspots/existing Wi-Fi infrastructure
<br>•	Display the position of the IoT device relative to Wi-Fi hotspots
<br>Software/Firmware Tools (Free and open sourced):
<br>•	JetBrains Python IDE, Community PyCharm, VS Code or equivalent
<br>•	Arduino IDE
<br>•	QT designer
<br><br>In our IoT project we will utilize JetBrains Community PyCharm Python IDE as it is open sourced, free and provides linting to assist in proper Python programming syntax and generates clean and neat code. PyCharm has been specifically designed for the Python programming language, so it offers the best functionality and ease of use for our Python program application.  
<br>The Arduino IDE will be the best development environment as it supports the Nano 33 IoT board and IoT Wi-Fi development. There are examples of code that we can gain inspiration from for our design in the Arduino IDE and help motivate us. The Arduino libraries for Wi-Fi and the Nano 33 IoT board will help reduce the amount of code that we have to write. The Arduino community is vast and comprehensive. If we experience difficulties in our code development, the Arduino community will be able to help resolve our coding issues. There is a possibility of using the Atmel Studio IDE, however we may not have the support nor the libraries that will help us achieve our programming goals.
<br> 
<br>
<br>Our decision to use QT designer as a drop and drag GUI application developer was for the ease of use and to develop a GUI application without the complexity of learning a new framework module in Python. There is plenty of support for this software tool as well.
<br>Hardware required:
<br>1.	ESP8266 or Arduino Nano 33 IoT (Digikey)
<br>2.	PC, Laptop or Desktop computer
<br>3.	Heart rate detection device XC3740 heartbeat module (Jaycar)
<br>
<br>The Arduino Nano 33 IoT offers everything that’s needed in terms of an IoT device, from Ublox Wi-Fi module, serial interfaces, 48Mhz 32-bit ARM microcontroller, crypto IC, and 3 axis accelerometers. It is relatively easy to program via the Arduino IDE and readily available. The Nano 33 IoT will be powered by an alkaline 9-volt or 3.6-volt lithium-ion battery and the XC3740 heartbeat monitor will be powered via the 3V3 output of the Nano 33 IoT. The serial communication from the XC3740 will be I2C (Inter-Integrated circuit) and will parse its data through this interface.
<br>The XC3740 heartrate module is simple to interface on the Nano 33 IoT using I2C, is low cost, and can be purchased from any local electronics component supplier store.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>
