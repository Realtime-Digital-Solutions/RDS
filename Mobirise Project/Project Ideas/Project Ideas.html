                <h2 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mbr-white mb-3 display-5"><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7">In the ever-growing world of Technology, there are always issues to be solved. One of the key factors in the pursuit of success and gaining traction as a business is by solving problems. Problem solving will always be appreciated in the modern world as consumers and businesses are striving to find ways to make their lives easier. This brings us to our Project Idea that we believe will compliment an industry that will travel hand in hand with the future, and that is Health. This device will give Doctors/Nurses/Medical personnel the tools to monitor and analyse their patients using a multitude of technology already available to us. By incorporating these established technologies, we believe that we can assist the Healthcare system and do our part in saving people’s lives.<br><br>We envision an IoT device that connects to existing Wi-Fi infrastructure in hospitals and in a patient’s home. The data is collected from the IoT device which is then reported to a console. The IoT device will be an ESP8266/Arduino Nano 33IoT that connects to a Local Hotspot or Wi-Fi connection, which then will be transmitted via Wi-Fi. The information will be displayed on a GUI (Graphical User Interface) in the form of a Web page. A PC application and smartphone and tablet support could be added in future updates. This device will display the data collected and report the position of the IoT device relative to a Wi-Fi hotspot or a Wi-Fi connection point using RSSI (Receiver Signal Strength Indicator) levels to determine position. GPS would be another alternative for position location however buildings and underground carparks do not always offer GPS signals as well as pose great difficulty. This is also highly costly. The data collected from the IoT device could be heart rate from a patient, relative position, and vital signs as well as position of a Nurse/Doctor in a hospital or position of vehicle in an underground carpark.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                <h1 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style mbr-white mb-3 display-5"><strong>Motivation</strong></h1>
                
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7">The motivation for this project came from the opportunity to work with high level technology. As the Lead Designer of this Project and work experience from his career at MST Global, Shane Mitchell found compelling technology in place for their underground tracking systems for their miners and various equipment. Shane envisages many uses for this technology in other fields of expertise. Backed up by a team of strong individuals with many skills to offer, we believe that Realtime Digital Solutions can head this project in the right direction.<br>
<br>Healthcare for us is where we will begin our journey. By helping, guiding, and reducing the load on the already congested Healthcare system, we believe that we can do our part to reduce casualties and ensure emergency services can get to patients on time. We are passionate and stand behind our product with the belief that we will be saving hundreds, if not thousands of lives. 
<br>
<br>Research shows (Malasinghe, et al., 2017) that restoring a patient's regular lifestyle as soon as possible is hugely beneficial to their recovery. This might include activities such as socializing, short trips to the grocery store or going to a cafe. Confining patients to a hospital room not only delays their recovery but ties up valuable and important hospital resources. It is for this reason that we also envisage a device that not only monitors a patient’s vital signs to ensure effective medical treatment, but also aids in restoring their freedom both within and outside of the hospital system. 
<br>
<br>The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of remote patient monitoring services. We have seen hospitals overwhelmed and understaffed. Our IoT device will allow hospital staff to tend to other patients, knowing they will be alerted if they are needed. Furthermore, without the need for human observation, the patient can return home sooner.<br><br><strong>Competing Technology: 
<br></strong>
<br><strong><em>Manage My Health 
</em></strong><br>
<br>This remote patient monitoring system provides a mobile application that enables enhanced communication between doctors and patients. This application provides appointment management including video appointment functionality. The app also provides remote monitoring functionality. This is achieved through patients uploading blood pressure readings and heart rate monitoring. It can also link with patient’s Fitbits and Apple Health Devices. The app also uses health questionnaires that patients can fill out and upload before going to appointments. The app also provides real time notifications from doctors that may involve updates to treatments and medication doses (Medtech Australia, Jun 5 2020). 
<br>
<br>In contrast to this technology, the RDS Medical IoT project would act as an enhanced remote monitoring API. Providing Health practitioners with location data for vulnerable patients in addition to remote healthcare monitoring functionality.<br>

                        Description</strong></h2>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mbr-white display-7">The IoT heart-rate monitor/tracker consists of an IoT device that is battery operated and is worn by the patient. It will use an ESP8266 or an Arduino Nano 33 IoT unit that will monitor the patient’s heartbeat via a sensor that detects light through the skin. This sensor uses infrared to achieve this. The sensor will require 3.3V to 5V for its voltage supply and this will be supported by the Arduino Nano or ESP8266. The IoT device will run from a 9V Alkaline battery or 3.6V lithium-ion battery and the internal regulators will supply the 5V. The communication from the heartbeat sensor to the IoT microcontroller will use I2C Serial Interface. This serial interface will provide the microcontroller with the data from the heartbeat sensor. This data will be analysed, processed, and then sent out via Wi-Fi (TCP/IP/UDP) to the monitoring software. The MAC address of the IoT device will aid in the individual identification of the device.<br>
<br>The PC will receive the data from the IoT device via Wi-Fi. The monitoring software will continuously gather data from the IoT device and display it on the GUI interface as beats per minute (BPM). This will be a preliminary measure to start the project and deliver some artifacts in a simple prototype form and to help us develop the technology from this basic platform. 
<br>
<br>The IoT device will serve as a Wi-Fi beacon and send a beacon message with heartrate data, the software will also monitor the receiver strength signal (RSSI) and Time Of Arrival Difference (TOAD) of the IoT device, enabling the PC to display an approximate location of the device. Time stamps will be sent to our software for analysis.  
<br>
<br>The location of the IoT device will be inaccurate with just the PC Wi-Fi however, if multiple Wi-Fi access points are involved this accuracy will improve. The Wi-Fi access points will also need to be synchronized, time wise. This will be a later development as we need multiple access points to test our development. Using a combination of TOAD and RSSI, we will be able to improve the accuracy of the device location. This will be displayed on a simple map initially, progressing to a more complex and detailed map alongside future developments of the device and software. The position of the sensor will rely heavily on the Wi-Fi Hotspots’ ability to receive quality radio signals. If there are enough <br>Wi-Fi hotspots, a process of RSSI triangulation and TOAD will be employed for the accuracy of location.<br>
<br>There will be a maximum and minimum setting for the heart-rate data, and an alarm will be triggered if the heart-rate moves above or below the set limits. The purpose of having this parameter in place is to alert a healthcare professional of an irregularity where a patient may require urgent medical attention. The monitoring software will be written in Python 3.x and will use socket programming to interface to the Wi-Fi IoT device. The IoT device will use C/C++ to program its firmware. <br>

<br>A web page displaying patient information and statistics can also be introduced with further developments. This web page can be hosted on a local server or in the cloud, and be responsible for storing and displaying vital data such as time, position, heart-rate etc. For future data analysis, development of an Ethernet network connection to the monitoring software will also be implemented. Future developments will also see over-the-air configuration of the IoT device improve for quick and easy deployment as the device is changed from one patient to another. This feature will be added to the existing applications and will require special permission access to program the device. Security measures such as encryption and password protection will be in place to protect sensitive information from theft and eliminate data corruption.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-7"><strong><em>Tools and Software/Firmware requirements
</em></strong><br><br>There are several software tools, hardware and programming languages that are required for our IoT project.  
<br> <br><strong>Our primary goal: </strong><br>
<br>•	Develop an application in Python
<br>•	Develop an IoT device to monitor patient vital signs
<br>•	Display the data from the IoT device on the PC application
<br>•	Use Wi-Fi hotspots/existing Wi-Fi infrastructure
<br>•	Display the position of the IoT device relative to Wi-Fi hotspots
<br><br><strong><em>Software/Firmware Tools (Free and open sourced):
</em></strong><br><br>•	JetBrains Python IDE, Community PyCharm, VS Code or equivalent
<br>•	Arduino IDE
<br>•	QT designer
<br><br>In our IoT project we will utilize JetBrains Community PyCharm Python IDE as it is open sourced, free and provides linting to assist in proper Python programming syntax and generates clean and neat code. PyCharm has been specifically designed for the Python programming language, so it offers the best functionality and ease of use for our Python program application.  
<br><br>The Arduino IDE will be the best development environment as it supports the Nano 33 IoT board and IoT Wi-Fi development. There are examples of code that we can gain inspiration from for our design in the Arduino IDE and help motivate us. The Arduino libraries for Wi-Fi and the Nano 33 IoT board will help reduce the amount of code that we have to write. The Arduino community is vast and comprehensive. If we experience difficulties in our code development, the Arduino community will be able to help resolve our coding issues. There is a possibility of using the Atmel Studio IDE, however we may not have the support nor the libraries that will help us achieve our programming goals.
<br><br>Our decision to use QT designer as a drop and drag GUI application developer was for the ease of use and to develop a GUI application without the complexity of learning a new framework module in Python. There is plenty of support for this software tool as well.
<br><br><strong><em>Hardware required:
</em></strong><br><br>1.	ESP8266 or Arduino Nano 33 IoT (Digikey)
<br>2.	PC, Laptop or Desktop computer
<br>3.	Heart rate detection device XC3740 heartbeat module (Jaycar)
<br>
<br>The Arduino Nano 33 IoT offers everything that is needed in terms of an IoT device, from Ublox Wi-Fi module, serial interfaces, 48Mhz 32-bit ARM microcontroller, crypto IC, and 3 axis accelerometers. It is relatively easy to program via the Arduino IDE and readily available. The Nano 33 IoT will be powered by an alkaline 9-volt or 3.6-volt lithium-ion battery and the XC3740 heartbeat monitor will be powered via the 3V3 output of the Nano 33 IoT. The serial communication from the XC3740 will be I2C (Inter-Integrated circuit) and will parse its data through this interface. (see figure 1 below).&nbsp;<br><br>The XC3740 heart-rate module is simple to interface on the Nano 33 IoT using I2C, is low cost, and can be purchased from any local electronics component supplier store.&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>•	C.
<br><br>The choice to use the Python programming language was simple. We have some experience with this general-purpose programming language and is becoming popular in the programming realm.
The connection to the Wi-Fi, from the Nano device will consists of a server/client relationship. The PC that will run the Python interface application, will use a basic socket server and bind to the Wi-Fi interface. The Python application is to be wrapped so it can be run as an executable file.
<br><br>The Arduino platform requires the use of the C programming language to program the Nano 33 IoT. Our team has some experience with this programming language. The Nano 33 IoT will serve as a client to the Python application and data will be extracted with the application and displayed on the GUI as heart-rate (BPM) and position/RSSI (Receiver Signal Strength Indication).<br><br>The ESP8266 and Arduino Nano 33 IoT are Wi-Fi capable devices with on board microcontrollers that can interface with many different hardware sensors, including the I2C serial interface.&nbsp;The IoT device will utilize the open-sourced Arduino IDE platform, applying C or C++ as the programming language.

A basic understanding of TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) will also be necessary. The PC application will require reasonable knowledge of Python, PyCharm/VS Code, as well as socket programming skills. The GUI will use TKinter or QT Designer software for development. TKinter and QT Designer are drag and drop GUI designers that will help us create a user-friendly design for the webpage. The software for both is free, open-sourced and require some time to learn. PyGame, which is a Python framework, may be used to design the IoT device location map.</p>

This technology is incredibly adaptable and versatile, increasing its appeal to organisations and sectors outside of the healthcare industry and providing an opportunity for future expansion. Our group hopes to learn the intricate aspects of the IT field by expanding our knowledge in Arduino or ESP8266 Platform, as well as various programming languages that will see this idea brought to life. As our programming language repertoire expands, so will our skillset and this, in turn, will soar us to greater heights as qualified industry professionals in the future.&nbsp;</p>
