                           This group has a very strong understanding of what is required for this assignment and been well organised in ensuring deadlines are met. Microsoft teams was used to a high level, recording meetings and setting up tasks was effective for group work, in the past I had only used teams for communication but have been surprised by its rounded nature such as storing files and working off the same document. Our group met religiously twice per week (Thursday & Sunday) these meetings were recorded in teams however could have been shorter. At times we drifted away from set agenda items. Overall groups can achieve much more than any individual and is important to prepare for the real world.

                            This was the first time I have worked in a group outside of school. All the fields I have been in have mainly comprised of one-on-one training or an individual’s effort to succeed in education. This is a nice change of pace and I welcome it as my industry is very unsociable. I can now see what the instructors are trying to teach us and the nature of the industry. The fact that a team must be a well-oiled machine with all gears working in harmony or conflict can arise. The fierceness, intensity and passion of the whole group's effort is what initially got us over the finish line. I learnt a lot from each person from their strength's in completing sections on time and effectively. As with anything in life, improvements or construction criticism is always welcomed and the only improvements I could come up with is that Commnication in MS Teams was little quiet at first, and I didn’t know who had completed which task. This picked up towards the end of the deadline as I believe it was just everyone getting to know each other. Mics could have been muted when not in use and at times didn’t know whether full attention was being given from leaking sound as some cameras were off. For the meeting length, there was a lot to discuss and keeping a full team happy is a challenge, especially given our time frame, so we had no choice but to debate certain issues until the group was satisfied. The one surprise which was a nice welcome, was Declan and the sheer fact of covering one of the areas we were trying to sort. This was the I.T. Work section, so that was much appreciated and unexpected from someone who joined late in the Assignment. The one thing I have learnt about groups is that if you don’t communicate and work together, challenges can arise. GitHub and how it was handled by the group was professional in my opinion. Everyone knew how to use it and contributed effectively. Overall, I couldn’t have completed the Assignment without them as any weakness I did have, was indirectly covered by another.

                           This was my first group assignment since high school, and I learnt a lot about how much effort it takes to make it work. A lot of planning went into setting up meetings, recording all our activity, agreeing on ideas and finding ways we could all contribute. We used our strengths and weaknesses to our advantage when it came to task delegation.
I believe our task prioritisation could have been improved. Initially we spent a disproportionate amount of time working on the Team Profile, which had a low weighting for the assignment. We also took a long time to agree on the direction for our Project Idea and we even changed direction around the halfway mark.
Having said this, I was surprised at how quickly we all got into a rhythm with each other. I think we were all quite nervous and camera shy in the beginning, but that quickly started to disappear, and the dialogue started to flow more freely as we all became more invested in the assignment.
Going forward with group work, I will endeavour to be as openly communicative as possible. I have learnt that this is essential in order to achieve fair contribution and allow for equal representation of ideas.

                            It was a pleasure to work with a group that has dedication and a strong will to achieve. We are all likeminded individuals that have an interest in I.T or similar technologies. I believe this was a driving force for our ability to complete this group assignment. Everyone in the team has learnt how to collaborate effectively however, this was not the case in beginning. Most of us were unsure what had to be done to achieve our goals as a team. This was overcome by attending the meetings and getting to know everyone and the diverse personalities of the team. The meetings served the purpose of allocating tasks and working with MS Teams to organise our work.
Our team needs some improvements when it comes to communication. Some members, I feel, were holding back on their ideas and thoughts. This has improved from the beginning but still needs some improvements by all. Its maybe due to a new situation that none of us are particularly experienced in.
Communication is the most important aspect of team collaboration, without this nobody in the team would know what to do or what someone else in the team was doing. Organisation with the tools is also an integral part in achieving our goals. The use of GitHub was particularly helpful as the amount of HTML/CSS code produced would have been difficult to manage without it. Everyone in the team knew what was expected of them, in this respect, and was simple to manage.

                            This was my first time working within an online collaboration group to complete a project. It took a week or so to get everyone onboard and we had a member drop the course, with Declan joining us halfway through the assignment. But we managed to get Declan caught up pretty quickly. Everyone has been very cooperative and willing to contribute to the group. Cameron has helped the group define and understand assignment tasks, Declan found us an IT professional to interview, Matthew has been a very energetic contributor, Rachel has helped to keep the group on track with the assignment, Shane has become the unofficial team leader and contributed his project idea and I helped to initialise the Microsoft Teams group and provide input to group decisions. Using Microsoft Teams became very helpful for sharing, accessing and collaborating on our assignment content. We probably spent more time discussing the assignment tasks and collating the data. I felt that we needed to begin building the website earlier than we did. Despite this, we have still managed to produce some great work. Coming into this assignment I was aware that I would struggle to make my voice heard and input my ideas. I pushed through my challenges and managed to communicate my feedback and ideas to the group. Although, this experience has taught me that I need to be more confident and prepared to support and back up my ideas. Our group meetings were invaluable for developing our project, But I have noticed that we struggled to stick with the agenda and would often break off into tangents, causing our meetings to run longer than an hour. Although the extra material discussed was usually important to the assignment, we probably need to implement stricter time keeping methods for our meetings. Perhaps the team needs to work on our assertive skills (I know I do!) and come to an understanding that it is acceptable to interrupt conversations for time keeping reasons in order to keep our meetings on schedule. Nevertheless, working with my team has been interesting and a great learning experience.
