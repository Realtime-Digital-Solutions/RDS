                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The Arduino platform was devised by Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, Italy and consists of open-sourced platform of hardware and software. The hardware is usually a single board micro-controller and associated electronics to support the micro-controller such as crystal oscillator, power supply, micro/mini-USB connector, USB to UART converter IC, LEDs, power socket and interface pins. The micro-controller is typically an 8-bit AVR Atmel or a 32-bit ARM Cortex device. The 8-bit AVR devices come in various memory sizes, depending on the model, and have different functions and number of IO pins. For example, the Arduino Mega has 256KB of flash memory for program storage and 54 digital pins, 16 analogue inputs, and 4 serial ports.<br>
<br>These single board computers were originally designed as an education tool to teach students/hobbyist/professionals how to program micro-controllers to control robotics, 3D printers, lighting, simple games, home automation, connection to the internet etc. They are affordable and available to the student/hobbyist/professional. The intention was to make it easy to understand with an open-source IDE that is simple to use. The Arduino micro-controller is programmed in the Arduino IDE using the C/C++ programming language and offers a variety of libraries and examples to help the programmer realise their project idea, easily and quickly. Prior to the Arduino platform, micro-controllers were programmed via JTAG or some form of ISP (In System Programming) which was expensive and difficult to use. The Arduino, on the other hand, has a boot-loader in the top of flash memory that allows the micro-controller to be easily programmed via USB. The Arduino can also be programmed via ISP if the programmer wishes to do so. <br>
<br>There is a vast community that supports the Arduino platform where hobbyists, students, and professionals share their ideas and code in an open-sourced environment. There is a plethora of libraries that support many different applications that can be used by the community that is constantly growing.
<br><br>Currently, the Arduino platform allows the programmer to develop their designs in the cloud for IoT projects. This technology enables the use of IoT Arduino devices to be controlled, updated, monitored, and connect to Amazon via a browser. The dashboard (browser), provided via the cloud, can be accessed with Android and iOS smart devices to control/monitor the Arduino IoT device. Applications can be developed on these smart devices and connect to the Arduino IoT device. The dashboard allows the use of simple widgets to control/monitor the IoT device which makes it simple to realise a sophisticated design. This relatively new Arduino development is possible due to the ease of access, low cost, and availability of modern cloud computing. <br>
<br>The future of Arduino lies in IoT and machine learning which can run on these platforms. Historically, machine learning was computationally expensive and dedicated to powerful computing systems to run the algorithms to train effective machine learning models [1]. TinyML (Tiny Machine Learning) is currently being developed for the use in embedded micro-controllers as micro-controllers become more powerful in their computing abilities and can run these machine learning algorithms. The key to TinyML is its capacity to run complex machine learning models on ultra-low power micro-controllers, locally, without the need to send data to the cloud, commonly known as edge computing [1]. Edge computing will revolutionize the use of embedded devices with IoT that require machine learning computation that may not have access to the cloud. TinyML will make use of affordable 32-bit micro-controllers to run the ML models used by edge computing. These devices can be deployed anywhere as they no longer require connection to the cloud. The implications of running deep learning algorithms on micro-controllers could be vast and make the world a whole lot smarter.

<br><strong>Impact of this technology:
</strong><br>Since the inception of the Arduino platform this technology has grown rapidly. The very first commercially available Arduino was the Arduino Serial in 2006. This board was programmed via a serial port (RS-232) on a computer. The next development was the Arduino Uno which added a USB to UART converter IC that allowed the programmer to use a modern generic USB port to program the micro-controller and used the Atmega328 8-bit IC.
<br>Within 14 years of the Arduino development this technology can now offer devices that run TinyML and IoT connectivity to the cloud. Below is a pictorial timeline of the Arduino platform development.

<br>In-text: (History of Arduino - Tutorial, 2021) Your Bibliography: Core Electronics. 2021. History of Arduino - Tutorial. [online] Available at: </em><https: core-electronics.com.au="" tutorials="" history-of-arduino.html=""><em> [Accessed 2 April 2021].
</em><br><br>This development has changed the education, hobbyist, and professional industry. Prior to Arduino, micro-controllers were primarily programmed using complicated and expensive development tools available only from the manufacturer of the micro-controller IC. This made it difficult for students and hobbyists to develop their own ideas and learn how micro controllers work. Now, with the Arduino platform it is easy to develop an idea and unlocks the complexity and cost that was only available to engineers and companies that had the knowledge or budget. The Arduino platform has also encouraged a vast student/maker community where ideas and code are shared on an open-sourced platform. This extends a collective knowledge base for people to refer to if they are stuck on a particular part of their project, it also encourages creativity among the community.
</https:></https:><br><https: medium.datadriveninvestor.com="" its-time-to-explore-tinyml-s-massive-potential=""><https: core-electronics.com.au="" tutorials="" history-of-arduino.html=""><br>The Arduino is a great technology tool for the student, hobbyist or professional. There as are several different platforms with similar functionality but not the ease of use the platform offers. Some professionals prefer to use different micro-controller brands and tools to develop their designs however, if the design requires a prototype, this can easily and quickly be realised on the Arduino platform. There is no threat to the embedded engineer’s career, yet.
<br>Historically, state machines and control logic have largely been replaced by micro-controllers. I see many newer designs replacing hard wired logic ICs with micro-controllers. This enables an easy change to the logic functionality by a simple firmware upgrade without having to change the circuit or PCB design. There is a significant cost advantage to this process.
<br>
<br><strong>Will this affect me?
</strong><br>The Arduino platform has had a significant affect on my knowledge of micro-controllers and the C/C++ programming language. When I studied electronic engineering, we designed a microprocessor system and a project for implementation. This project was coded in assembly language for the Motorola HC11 family and was tedious to say the least even though it was a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) micro-controller. The HC11 had external memory and peripherals which included an EPROM 2KB, bus/address latches and RAM. The EPROM had to be erased with ultraviolet light and programmed by a dedicated programmer. These two items were extremely expensive (UV Eraser ~$800 and Programmer ~$2500) and well out of reach of the average student. I could have used the C programming language to program the HC11 however, you needed to purchase the C compiler for the HC11 family and again, it was expensive and required a company to purchase. An individual was not able to obtain such technology. In comparison, the Arduino platform is a breeze to develop on and the cost is almost nothing. </https:></https:><br><https: medium.datadriveninvestor.com="" its-time-to-explore-tinyml-s-massive-potential=""><https: core-electronics.com.au="" tutorials="" history-of-arduino.html="">
<br>The Arduino platform allows me to develop my ideas and projects easily and quickly without the worry of expensive/complex development tools. If I get stuck on a particular problem, whilst mid development, I can search the community forums for inspiration, maybe someone else has experienced the same issue. This was not possible prior to the advent of the Arduino community or the internet.
</https:></https:><br><https: medium.datadriveninvestor.com="" its-time-to-explore-tinyml-s-massive-potential=""><https: core-electronics.com.au="" tutorials="" history-of-arduino.html=""><br>My parents including myself are aging and with age comes physical/health decline. I can identify some areas that the Arduino could possibly help my family in the near future. One area would be automation, with robotics, of physical chores that sometimes become difficult as we age. Another area would be health monitoring via wearables with the internet and IoT. Driver-less vehicles will have a plethora of embedded micro-controllers to automate and control various parts of the vehicle. There are many different areas where this technology could affect humanity. Currently, micro-controllers are already in many household and industrial products. I can only see the use of embedded micro-controllers will increase in the future.&nbsp;<br></https:></https:><https: www.collabera.com="" find-a-job="" career-resources="" how-will-cloud-computing-affectit-jobs=""><https: www.crn.com="" news="" cloud="" 10-future-cloud-computing-trends-towatch-in-2021=""><https: learn.g2.com="" future-of-cloud-computing=""><https: www.researchgate.net="" publication="" 225252747_cloud_computing_state-of-theart_and_research_challenges=""></https:></https:></https:></https:></p>
