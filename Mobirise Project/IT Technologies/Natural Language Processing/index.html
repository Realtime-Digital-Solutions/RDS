                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><br>Natural language processing, or NLP, is technology used to allow computers and programs to understand and communicate with human language. NLP is important for software and programs to understand and index unstructured text. Unstructured text is prevalent on the internet and in businesses. It consists of text that lacks metadata and limits how software may access or find relevant meaning from the text (Cameron McKenzie, Sept 2015). Other examples of unstructured text include emails, social media posts, word documents and verbal audio that has been converted to text. Just about anything you write could be considered unstructured text. NLP makes it much more intuitive to access, gather information and make use of this data.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;NLP combines computer science and artificial intelligence and uses computational linguistics in conjunction with statistical, machine learning and deep learning algorithms (IBM Cloud Education, 2020). NLP is reliant on deep learning models and AI. In order for an application to understand our verbal language, it first uses a trained algorithm to analyse our speech audio and identify our verbal sounds in order to construct words. The process implements further analysis with a database to correct mismatched words and apply syntax structure. Essentially organising and converting our verbal data into formatted and readable sentences. But this output of text doesn’t mean much to a computer or program without implementing a “natural language understanding” AI. Using semantic analysis techniques and a database developed through deep learning, this AI strives to provide meaning to our words and sentences, that computers and software can understand. This involves “named entity recognition”, identifying words that can be categorised into groups, like names and places. And “Word sense disambiguation”, applying meaning to words based on their context and position with surrounding words. Google has developed an NLP system adept enough to apply advanced natural language understanding to unstructured text. This includes recognising and analysing sentiment tones and emotional inflections, entity and ownership information and classifying words and content (Google Cloud, 2021). NLP also involves “natural language generation”, which attempts to imitate human language using databases to analyse semantic intentions (Dr. Michael J. Garbade, 16 Oct 2018). Chatterbots rely on natural language generation to provide users with human like responses. <br><br>NLP is widely integrated into technology including virtual assistants such as Google Assistant, Alexa, Cortana and Bixby. These applications use NLP to understand our commands and provide relevant feedback. Microsoft Office uses NLP to provide spelling and grammar correction. Googles’ translate application uses NLP to make meaningful associations with our text and convert it into another language. Call centres use NLP technology to provide interactive voice response applications. So, when you call Telstra or Centrelink, you are talking to an automated system that is using natural language processing. A more recent - and somewhat controversial - development has been social media sentiment analysis. Which uses NLP to analyse peoples’ responses and opinions from social media channels to gather information on peoples’ attitudes and emotions in regards to products, promotions and events (IBM Cloud Education, 2020). This is becoming popular with businesses as this information helps them fine tune product designs and advertising campaigns. Other uses of NLP include spam detection, chatterbots and dictation applications. It is pretty innovative stuff, and this technology is only going to continue to become more refined and integrated.&nbsp;<br><br>Some state-of-the-art developments with NLP include “Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)”, “Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)” and “The Bert Model” (zappy.ai, 2021). RNN’s are neural networks for training databases and features incorporating previous learned data into the next simulation segment. LSTM networks are similar to RNNs and provide easier methods for the neural network to remember past results. The Bert Model helps to fine-tune pretrained models. These are all new techniques being used to train NLP deep learning models.&nbsp;<br><br>The rise of cloud computing has made NLP more accessible and contributed to the advancement of NLP systems. Utilising cloud infrastructure services has facilitated the development of NLP deep learning models, helping developers to make enhanced and complex NLP systems. With further research and development anticipated to continually make computers and applications smarter at understanding human language and more capable of utilising information from unstructured text.&nbsp;<br><br>Natural Language Processing has become a crucial tool for industries. Making it more efficient to access and manage written data. Providing businesses with tools to achieve high productivity, fast turnaround times and improved quality in professional work (Wolters Kluwer Corporate, 29 April 2020). NLP has become prevalent in the medical industry, with information extraction supporting health organisations with “Quality Measure reporting, risk stratification, medical necessity review and predictive analytics” (Wolters Kluwer Corporate, 29 April 2020). This is helping doctors to research medical case studies, accurately diagnose patients and identify best case medical procedures. NLP is also highly impacting the marketing industry. Providing tools to extract information and analyse trends. Helping marketers to refine their campaigns and more accurately target their audiences. However, advances in NLP systems could lead to exploitation of peoples’ data, as what happened in the Cambridge Analytica case. Marketing campaigns and advertisements can come close to crossing the threshold of becoming manipulative and exploitative. Companies will need to be careful about how they access and use this type of data.<br><br>The use of chatterbots and automated call centres is becoming ubiquitous within the customer service side of businesses. In the workforce, chatterbots are considered a disruptive technology, potentially replacing a human job requirement. But the use of this technology offers job opportunities in other areas (Miklas Vernersson, 23 Feb 2021). This could include technicians to maintain the software and a team to research, develop and refine the software to suit specific business requirements and customer needs. Automating customer service processes has also allowed for businesses to invest their resources into other areas and potentially create additional “human” jobs into areas with room to grow.&nbsp;<br><br>Another impact of NLP use that has recently been observed is the effect virtual assistants may have on children who access them. With the concern that the demanding interaction to communicate with these services interferes with children’s development to learn respect and manners towards others. The fear is that children are becoming comfortable with commanding virtual assistants and not having to use manners to speak with them, effectively praising demanding attitudes. To combat this, Google and Amazon have implemented solutions into their virtual assistants that recognise children and praise the use of manners. Google Assistant will now ask children for “the magic word” before complying when a child hasn’t said please. And Amazons “Echo Dot Kids Edition” will thank children for asking nicely when manners are used (Conor Cawley, 25 July 2018). It is good to see companies recognising this issue, but it remains to be seen whether this activity will actually impact children.&nbsp;<br><br>Technologies that utilise NLP have become integrated into my everyday life. I have IoT devices set up through my home and are connected through Google Hub. Even my TV and sound system have voice command technology. This has made it convenient for me to control lighting and play music and YouTube videos through voice commands. Another benefit of this is being able to control lights and play music when I am away from home as a security measure to make it appear as though someone is home. NLP applications like “Android Auto” and “Apple Car Play” have (somewhat arguably) made driving safer providing a handsfree solution to access maps and input directions, and answer phone calls. I say arguably as authorities have considered, and may recognise, these activities as distracting for drivers and recommend pulling over (when safe to do so) to access these facilities.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;There is also speculation that virtual assistants may record your conversations in order to provide specific marketing and advertising to you and give your information to 3rd parties. I could not find any information that supports this however, Google Assistant does record some conversations and may use it to further train their NLP AI. It is not clear as to whether they use this information for more malevolent purposes. The conversations that Google Assistant records are accessible to users and users can delete them (Andrew Griffin, 10 Sept 2020). The use of NLP and how it may be used to analyse our conversational and textual data for marketing and advertising purposes does lead to some moral issues though. As mentioned with the Cambridge Analytica case. Using NLP AI to analyse peoples’ data to produce psychological profiles and manipulation techniques. Just about all technology has potential to be used for negative and malicious purposes. Further laws and policies may need to be investigated and implemented to protect people from the misuse of NLP services. <br><br>NLP has exciting potential to benefit humankind. Providing an intuitive way for people to communicate and access information from computers and devices. There has been an interesting development called Google Duplex AI Assistant, that aims to contact businesses, utilising natural language generation to have “real” conversations, to make doctors’ appointments, order food for you and purchase goods (Tech Insider 2018). NLP is becoming a valuable tool to help businesses grow and become more efficient. And is being utilised for developing deep learning models to analyse substantial amounts of unstructured text and solve complex problems. NLP models are becoming more advanced and smarter, and will continue to be integrated into technology, businesses and everyday life.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>References:</strong><br>IBM Cloud Education, 2 July 2020, Natural Language Processing, IBM Cloud Learn Hub, Viewed 2 March 2021 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/natural-language-processing " class="text-success text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/natural-language-processing </a>
