                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>History
</strong><br>When the public hear the word blockchain they generally think “Bitcoin” however blockchain technology has a history a little deeper than just Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency in general. 
<br>
<br>A blockchain like protocol was initially proposed by Cryptographer David Chaum in 1982 . The eventual concept of Proof-of-Work (PoW) by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1993 provided the mechanism in which transactions on the blockchain would eventually be verified (Alan T. Sherman, 2019)
<br>
<br>In 2008, a group or individual by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto pieced together the above developments and ultimately released a white paper describing what is today known as the blockchain and the cryptocurrency Bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008).<br><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>What is Block Chain?</strong><strong><br></strong>The blockchain in its simplest form can be compared to a physical ledger as a record of transactions which would be added following the previous entry. Likewise, in the blockchain, records known as blocks, are added to the chain and cryptographically connected to the previous entry or block by a hash (mathematical algorithm). Each block contains multiple data points including a timestamp, transaction data and the hash of the previous block (figure 1).<br> 
<br>It worth noting that the initial block in the chain is void of the hash data since it has no preceding block. This block is often referred to as the genesis block.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Blockchains however require some mechanism to ensure only one chain exists and that entries to the chain can be applied in turn. One such mechanism is the consensus algorithm called Proof of Work (PoW). <br>
<br>PoW in its simplest form requires the computation of complex mathematical equations (cryptography). These equations appear only once and are so complicated that only powerful computers can solve them. This therefore leads to the security of the blockchain and in turn the verification of each entry of the ledger.<br>
<br>The cryptocurrency Bitcoin for example uses Proof of Work (PoW) (Nakamoto, 2008) as its consensus mechanism and the results of which are public broadcasted across the blockchain network. <br>
<br>A consensus policy is required in order to determine how blocks are added to the chain. There are a number of policies which exists and are dependent on the implementation of the blockchain. <br>
<br>Decentralized blockchains, I.E those which are managed by a public network where consensus is agreed by some consensus policy. These are often thought of as permissionless blockchains where anyone may add block to the chain provided its agreed by the consensus policy.
<br><br>However, not all blockchains are “decentralised”. Some blockchain may be considered permissioned because a group or organisation controls who can add blocks to and verify the chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br><strong>Current state of play for the blockchain.</strong><br>One of the most infamous implementations of blockchain technology is Bitcoin. Bitcoin was developed to enable financial transactions between parties without the need for a trusted third to ensure fairness. Bitcoin uses the PoW as its method of consensus.  The PoW arrangement requires energy intensive computation. Currently the bitcoin uses and estimated 121TWhs of electricity per year, more than countries like the UAE and Argentina.  Bitcoins block chain implementation is not without its limitations either.
<br><br>For Bitcoin to seriously compete with well-established payment methods, some things have to change. For example, compare the transaction speeds of Bitcoin Vs Visa. Bitcoin can achieve 7 transactions per second whereas Visa can process 1,700 in the same time. This is not surprising since Bitcoin and PoW provides public security of the network however the inverse of this is low network speed. Visa on the other hand, being a private organization not using blockchain can process transactions how they please and favor the speed of their network over the competition.

                    What is the Likely impact on society?&nbsp;</strong><br>As we have discussed above. Blockchain has some benefits in terms of security, ledgers and databases. Blockchain undoubtedly was made publicly popular by its use for cryptocurrencies and while cryptocurrencies have seen a huge rise in popularity the blockchain has yet to be adopted by big financial institutions.
<br><br>Blockchain technology is however being experimented with in other spaces, trying to solve problems with security and honesty.
<br><br>Take for example election voting, voting distrust in some African nations is overwhelmingly common (Morlin-Yron, 2016). One use for the blockchain is a tamper resistant digital ballot box as proposed by Horizon State which has seen some adoption by Australian and New Zealand government (horizon, n.d.).
<br><br>One current issue plaguing blockchain technologies is scalability. Current and popular PoW consensus mechanism is energy and time consuming and often results in slow transaction speeds. <br>
<br>This has given birth to other types of consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake (PoS). However, the trade-off is centralization. PoS is ideally suited to closed of centralised applications where business or organisations wish to take advantage of the blockchains transparency and fairness.
<br><br>Blockchains use cases appear to be endless from providing a currency which does not discriminate and is available to anyone to secure and fair contracts or voting systems.
<br><br>In the digital age, it’s difficult to see how blockchain technology wont become part of everyday life. Even if we cant touch it or make sense of it, in the future, spending our hard earned cash or protecting ourselves from cyber threats may be more secure and efficient thanks to blockchain implementations. (Spatz, 2018).<br><strong><br></strong><br><br><strong>How will this affect us?</strong><strong><br></strong>One of the unique things about blockchain technology is that it could be implemented as either a new service or tool or to increase security and efficiency of existing tools.
<br><br>As previously mentioned, Horizon State are using the blockchain in a revolutionary way that is transforming how we might cast a vote whilst increasing the security of this process. This is an example of how we might interact with the blockchain in a more direct form.
<br><br>However, as we go about our daily lives in this digital age, we might interact with blockchain more frequently without even realising it.
<br><br>Consider the mechanism of transferring fiat currency from one bank to another internationally. Today, this uses technology established in 1973 called SWIFT (Blaney, n.d.). The SWIFT systems itself does not handle the exchange of funds but only provides instructions between the banks to conduct the transfer. Not only are banks often not the cost-effective way in terms of the exchange rate they provide, but the process of transferring money can also take up to 5 business days (Government, n.d.).
<br><br>Now, some organizations have taken to blockchain to fix the way we spend and use our own money. Ripple, a company out of the USA has developed what they call Ripplenet (Ripple, n.d.). Ripplenet uses blockchain and their digital asset or token (XRP) to make these financial transactions almost instantly. In short, these transactions happen because both parties agree on the value of the XRP token and given the speed of their blockchain network, the transaction can be completed in a matter of seconds and therefore not exposing the banks to additional risk from a change in exchange rates.
<br><br>The blockchain technology that Ripple has implemented is currently being used by some banks around the world and someday may become common place in everyday life.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><br></strong><br><strong>References:</strong><br>Alan T.
