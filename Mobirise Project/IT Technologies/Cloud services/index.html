                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">IT Technologies - Clouds, Services, Servers
<br>Cloud computing technology has become a key feature in modern day computing. It
<br>facilitates the delivery of services via the Internet. These services can include servers,
<br>software, infrastructure, storage, networking and databases. These resources are often
<br>leased out to consumers and businesses using a consumption-based pricing model with no
<br>up-front investments.
<br><br><strong>There are 3 cloud types:</strong><br>
<br><strong>Public</strong><br>Public cloud vendors provide storage, applications and various services via the Internet and
<br>is available to the general public.
<br><br><strong>Private</strong>
<br>This is infrastructure where access is limited to particular individuals or groups, such as
<br>those working within a department of an organisation.
<br><br><strong>Hybrid
</strong><br>This is a combination of both public and private clouds, offering the benefits of multiple
<br>models. This allows an organisation to have less-sensitive elements of their business in a
<br>public cloud and keep the rest stored in a private cloud or local server.
<br>For many organisations who haven’t made the switch or are hesitant, the Hybrid-cloud
<br>approach is proving popular.
<br>In a cloud computing environment, there are 3 main types of services:
<br><br><strong>IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)</strong>
<br>This is when a company can provide infrastructure to the consumer from a remote location.
<br>This is done using virtualisation technology. The provider ensures security for your data and
<br>an uninterrupted service for your operations.
<br><br><strong>PaaS (Platform as a service)
</strong><br>This service provides developers with an online framework where software can be built.
<br><br><strong>SaaS (Software as a service)
</strong><br>This service provides access to software hosted within the cloud. This service enables real
<br>time collaboration and requires no hardware installation.
<br>
<br><em><img border="0" src="Cloud-computing-architecture.png" width="200" height="500" /></em><br>(Zhang, 2010)
<br><br>Companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon have invested heavily in cloud
<br>technology and are industry leaders when it comes to cloud computing. Azure, AWS and
<br>Google Cloud Platform are just some examples of the state-of-the-art infrastructure already
<br>available to consumers. As more consumers and organisations move their business to the
<br>cloud, this competitive market will create opportunity for further innovation.
<br><br>Today, organisations are using cloud technology to completely rethink their business
<br>models. Historically, the cloud has been used for basic computing, storage and networking,
<br>however our current cloud ecosystems are using AI and API technology to create a more
<br>customised approach.
<br><br>The main enabling technology behind cloud computing is virtualisation. Virtualisation refers
<br>to the technology used to create a virtual version of an operating system, server, storage
<br>device or network, etc. It uses software that simulates hardware functionality to create
<br>multiple virtual servers, otherwise known as virtual machines. By utilising this technology,
<br>companies are able to provide remote infrastructure, platforms and software. Because this
<br>technology is highly accessible and scalable, both individuals and organisations are seeking
<br>its services to conduct their business going forward.
<br><br>Over the next 3 years, as the world migrates to the cloud, the demand for data storage and
<br>data security will increase. Many companies are being inundated with Big Data and
<br>traditional IT departments are struggling to store, analyse and manage all of this data. These
<br>problems can limit an organisation’s ability to respond to today’s quickly changing business
<br>environments in a timely manner.
<br><br>The increase in the use of IoT technology, machine learning, AI and natural language
<br>processing in our everyday devices is creating huge amounts of data.
<br>We have existing data centres around the world which help facilitate Big Data being stored
<br>in the cloud. Big Data and how it can be stored in an efficient, secure and sustainable way
<br>will influence the direction of this technology.
<br><br>In an effort to effectively analyse these massive databases, the use of quantum computing
<br>technology will increase, as this technology is able to complete complicated algorithm
<br>calculations at powerful speeds. Major corporations such as IBM, Microsoft and Google are
<br>already beginning to incorporate this technology to gain a competitive advantage in the
<br>market (Saleem, 2020).
<br><br>While the rise in demand for cloud-based services grow, so does the demand for technology
<br>that brings data storage and processing closer to the end-user, such as edge computing or
<br>serverless computing.
<br>Advancements in areas of AI, serverless computing and quantum computing are at the core
<br>of predicted trends in cloud computing.
<br><br>As more companies seek to create faster, cheaper and more reliable cloud services, more
<br>businesses will change the way they conduct their business to reap the benefits of this
<br>technology. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the global public cloud infrastructure
<br>market is set to hit $120 billion later this year, as more organisations move their business to
<br>the cloud (Goodison, 2020).
<br><br>Given this, it is likely that key metrics will improve as organisations spend less time, energy
<br>and money on foundational infrastructure.
<br>Having said this, however, an increase in security measures will be necessary as more
<br>people work from home and access services in the cloud using their own devices on
<br>unsecured servers.
<br><br>Cloud technology has meant that the consumer can live in a more seamlessly integrated
<br>world amongst their devices. Competitive pricing models and customised storage plans are
<br>just some of the ways the consumer benefits from this technology. If it weren’t for cloud
<br>computing, the impacts of the recent Covid-19 pandemic would have been far worse. The
<br>events of 2020 revealed the weaknesses of global enterprises, leaving companies cut off and
<br>desperately trying to find remote solutions. Fortunately, when the world went into
<br>lockdown, a lot of industries were able to have their employees continue to work from
<br>home (an impossible task without the use of this technology).
<br><br>However, advancements in cloud computing have led to large quantities of data needing to
<br>be processed and analysed at speeds which humans are incapable of.
<br>As our world becomes more cloud-based, AI will begin to replace humans in the workforce.
<br>While the use of AI increases in areas such as facial recognition, machine learning and
<br>natural language processing, the demand for human-based jobs will decrease in areas such
<br>as data processing, surveying and analytics. IT jobs in areas such as data administration and
<br>helpdesk support will decline, as IaaS providers will have these features built into their
<br>services.
<br><br>In some respects, however, new job opportunities will arise for humans to create solutions
<br>to the issues caused by AI such as Big Data storage and security. The demand for more data
<br>centres and the expansion of existing ones will also continue to provide jobs within the
<br>industry. Software Developers and Business Analysts are predicted to see continued growth,
<br>as these jobs will be crucial to the success of organisations managing their business in the
<br>cloud. In addition to this, we will continue to see growth in areas of cyber security, as more
<br>business takes place in an online environment where privacy will become harder to
<br>maintain (Collabera, n.d.).
<br><br>Cloud computing has had an enormous effect on the technology I use in my everyday life. I
<br>make use of this technology when I am studying online and using SaaS models such as Office
<br>and Teams to share and collaborate in real time with my fellow students. I also use the
<br>cloud to store music and photos that can be access later from a range of my devices.
<br>I look forward to being able to conduct more of my work and studies remotely. I believe the
<br>developments surrounding cloud computing will provide myself and those around me with a
<br>much more convenient and customised world.
<br><br>I have friends and family who are now working remotely on a permanent basis with the use
<br>of cloud technology. Whilst there may be some who struggle to adapt to life in the cloud,
<br>such as the elderly and computer illiterate, the majority of those I know will welcome it, as it
<br>means no longer investing in physical storage solutions or only being able to access data
<br>from one device at a time.
