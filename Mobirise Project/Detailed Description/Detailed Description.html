                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-7">Our group is shooting for the absolute best iteration of a product we think is viable in the modern world. We aim to assist the Health Care industry in creation of a device to ensure the survival of our species by helping to emit one of the many causes of heart failure. Firstly, we achieve this with our monitoring software that streamlines our data, direct to medical professionals who can make the best educational and logical decision on how to proceed. As you can see from the file “Landscape”, in the Overview section of this report, the current technology that our hospitals use today is the Holter monitor. From a technical standpoint, our overall aim is to achieve an eventual complete and polished product adhering to the <a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/devices-argmd-01.pdf" class="text-info" target="_blank">Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Medical Devices</a> (tga.gov.au) and working with manufacturers, to ensure we meet high quality standards. To achieve this, we have broken down our thought process into individual goals in the allocated time frame by assigning each team member as we also refer ourselves as, to a specific task. Here is a breakdown of the unified progress.</p>

Shane had been working on a project that he believed was feasible within the time frame given his background and experience as an Electronics Engineer. As a patient covered by health care, Matthew offered insight into the medical industry and the technology they were using. Cameron, Declan, Rachel and Zachary, saw the potential in the idea, that it was interesting not only from a technological standpoint but from a necessary one. We achieved this goal by deliberating, “Who it should be aimed for” and “What can it do.” We believed this was the best route to go for and made our choice.

Such as hardware, software, technical and educational limitations. As we were working with time constraints, Shane applied his technical knowledge in sourcing the hardware and software to operate the device, including the communication protocol for relaying data to the analytical software. The rest of the group were assigned tasks to research the abilities of the hardware and software as well as self-educating ourselves in the programming languages that was going to run the backend. Data communication would be handled by <br>Wi-Fi, a wireless networking technology which is used for Local Area Networks and Internet services. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) would be made in <br><a href="https://build-system.fman.io/qt-designer-download" class="text-info" target="_blank">Qt Designer</a>. We used <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" class="text-info" target="_blank">Arduino</a>, an open-source electronics software platform that allows communication between the electronic hardware by receiving inputs from the sensors to operate the functions it is programmed to do. The programming language chosen was <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="text-info" target="_blank">Python</a>, compiled in  <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/" class="text-info" target="_blank">PyCharm</a>, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), to handle the Python Code. We chose Python because of its ease of use and features it offered suited our project. A minor iteration of the <a href="https://www.guru99.com/c-programming-language.html#:~:text=Summary%201%20%27C%27%20was%20developed%20by%20Dennis%20Ritchie,operating%20systems%20and%20hardware%20platforms.%20More%20items...%20" class="text-info" target="_blank">C</a> programming language was handled by Shane, given his experience.

The planning and progress that went into this was phenomenal and an attest to the skill and backed up by the group’s motivation and drive, saw us succeed by assisting one another based on our individual strengths. We decided to call our device “<strong>PulseBeat</strong>”, after the features that it offers. The ability to monitor the pulse to calculate heart beat rhythmical patterns, blood rate oxygen levels and if the patient has collapsed. The device could be worn of a part of the body that detects the human pulse.

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><em>The GUI (Graphical User Interface) was created in Qt Designer. This was then converted into Python code for PyCharm to interpret the GUI into a working visual presentation. Our goal here was to take the static model of Qt Designer and forge it into a representation of what the medical personnel can visually understand and document. We implemented a new feature in this stage called Man-Down. If a patient’s heart rate dips below a certain level, an alarm will be triggered and sent out to medical personnel as data for them to analyse the situation. This is achieved by utilising an Arduino with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer" class="text-info" target="_blank">Accelerometer</a>, connected to a heart rate sensor. This will measure the force of acceleration and positioning of the body to calculate whether the patient has suffered an attack, be it heart related or alternate source.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">As with many projects, whether funded or unfunded, issues do sometimes arise. We plan to do as much as possible in the given time frame that we have been allocated. As a team and we think that we have achieved the best possible results based on that. The most important parts of the project are that we attained a working replica of the device that addresses many issues that the Traditional Holter Monitor poses. We have gathered all the necessary information to deem the project as feasible as we can, based on our statistical findings and research, with experience from a group member in the field as well as competitive products in the consumer market. Another important part of the project is the technical aspects to showcase our device in its infancy as a Beta release, provided we have worked out the bugs. Our priorities mainly lay in the creation of “PulseBeat”, as we believe that it has the potential to be something significant and an interest to outside parties. However, if we were to choose an aspect that should have priority over the rest, it would be the documentation of the device, explaining how the technology functions in the Backend aspect.
<br>As mentioned, we were working with constraints to implement a working model and used the time as effectively as we could to achieve our goal. If we only had enough time or resources for one of our goals, we would allocate it to Research and Development. This is an important area where a vision is sometimes too complex and complicated for a team to achieve based on overall experience within the industry. These skills take time to enhance, and we must consider these limitations as well. Without proper planning and an intricate thought process, it would be building a project with a means to no end.<br></p></blockquote>
