                <p class="mbr-text mbr-white mbr-fonts-style display-7">The motivation for our Medical IoT project, which we have decided to name “PulseBeat”, came from our sheer interest in helping people. "What area needs more assistance than any others when it comes constant improvement?” <br>The Health Care industry. Technology has always done great wonders for Health and everyone has someone dear to them that they cherish, who can offer knowledge and wisdom to a younger generation. Our project started to gain traction after a brief discussion within the group that this was of a beneficial stature. The Medical field is a never-ending quest for constant improvement and the research that laboratory professionals and all involved personnel provide to conquer old and new diseases and ailments are miracles in their own mind. If we could relieve the Health System, which is currently overpopulated with patients and reaching capacity limits in providing the appropriate care, as well as resources limited, we would be doing our part in securing a future. Major companies are backed up by financial institutions and the fact that we believe in our product as Version 1.0 is a testament to the perseverance of the Team.
Current I.T. trends suggest that there are iterations of similar products out in the market. As with many ideas, someone has already tried to solve a problem. This is one of the key fundamental qualities needed to achieve the goal of being successful, be it personally or financially.<br><br>In the never-ending strive for perfection within the technological field, we as a team can only contribute to the many ideas out in force today. Australian Health Care is one of, if not the strongest of the nations in world and it is our duty as citizens to ensure the survival and flourishing of Australians and humans as a whole. We live in a world of IoT (Internet of Things) and nearly every device that is released today, has communication and internet capability among a string of devices all connected. Our product is among many that will try to “solve a problem.”<br><br>In accordance with future Employer needs, our team shows great initiative for brainstorming ideas, seeking out the sources needed to sustain the idea, troubleshooting, belief in future proofing versions and working as a team to conquer any discrepancies that we encounter. These are all qualities that employers are searching for when building a team. Programming skills will come in time, with an applied mindset. Our alternate goal as students, is to constantly learn from our mistakes and apply the new education we receive as we strive to become experienced professionals and better people.<br></p>

These battery-operated devices are about the size of a postcard. The patient usually wears it via a strap around the neck or an elastic band around the waist. There are EKG (Electrocardiogram) leads that attach to the chest.
<br><br>The device collects data recorded from the ECG continuously for a given time. Typically, it is used anywhere from 24 - 48 hours to a week or more. The challenge with Holter monitors is that they can be cumbersome and delay important treatment. Patients must return the device to the doctor’s office.
Then, the doctor must download and analyse the data before meeting again with the patient to discuss the results.
If the problem is not detected during this monitoring period, the cardiologist may prescribe additional time wearing the Holter. Or he may prescribe an implantable continuous remote monitoring device instead.

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The traditional Holter monitor, even though effective and brilliant for its time, is bulky and cumbersome to wear for the patient. It also requires constant monitoring from the patient to be in the correct body position as not to obstruct and hinder any sensors, wiring and physical buttons on the device. Any minor heart palpitations the patient does suffer, must be recorded with the press of a physical button or the data is not recorded. Any major cardiac issues need to be reported in the manner of a phone call to emergency services, some of which time constraints is the limiting factor in saving someone’s life. It does not have any waterproof capability, there are tremendous costs to the medical industry if the device is damaged and it must be physically returned to the appropriate sources for data analysation. All of which has huge ramifications if any unorthodox incidents were to occur in the set time frame as well as the possibility for corrupted data. The patient must also reinitialise the procedure in accordance with the Cardiologist’s recommendation if there are any unusual circumstances. For these inconveniences, we believe that this is obsolete technology.</p></blockquote>

The health system in general, its products, devices and resources undergo rigorous testing procedures in order to pass quality control and adherence to the <a href="https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/devices-argmd-01.pdf" class="text-info" target="_blank">Australian Government Department of Health Australian regulatory guidelines for medical devices</a>.</p></blockquote>

This relieves the stress on the paramedics and medical personnel by providing them with data to pinpoint the location of the patient, thus reducing the overall time spent searching. We also have the capability to send this data direct over Wi-Fi to a medical professional for analysis and decision making. As ideas are explored, more features will come online to realise its potential and mitigate any issues, leveraging existing and new technology. Our product aims to fix these issues by analysing the data that we have gathered about these products and possibly speaking to the parties involved, both in the professional manufacturing and medical industry to gain an insight into to the needs of the patient and the healthcare system.</p>
