                                  Our group’s goal is for the best iteration of a product we think the medical industry may benefit from.
                                   We aim to assist the Health Care industry in creating a device to ensure the survival of our species by helping to reduce one of the many causes of death, heart failure.
                                   Firstly, we achieve this with our monitoring software that streamlines our data, directly to medical professionals who can make the best educated and logical decision on how to proceed.
                                   As you can see from the file “Landscape”, in the overview section of this report, the current technology that our hospitals use today is the Holter monitor.
                                   From a technical standpoint, our overall aim is to achieve a professional product adhering to the Australian regulatory guidelines for medical devices (tga.gov.au) and working with manufacturers to ensure we meet high quality standards.
                                   To achieve this, we have broken down our thought process into individual goals in the allocated time frame by assigning each team member as we also refer ourselves as, to a specific task. Here is a breakdown of the unified progress.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-0 mt-2 display-7"><strong>Goal 1. </strong></h5>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                                  First on our agenda was the brainstorming session. Each week our team met on Microsoft Teams, which features the ability to organise and share files and tasks among invited members.
                                  Shane had been working on a project that he believed was feasible within the period, given his background and experience as an Electronics Engineer.
                                  As a patient covered by health care, Matthew offered insight into the medical industry and the technology they were using. Cameron, Declan, Rachel, and Zachary, saw the potential in the idea, that it was interesting not only from a technological standpoint but from a necessary one.
                                  We achieved this goal by deliberating, “Who it should be aimed for” and “What can it do.” We believed this was the best route to go for and made our choice.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-0 mt-2 display-7"><strong>Goal 2. </strong></h5>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                                  After deciding on the project, we implemented a basic structure for the needs of the device. Such as hardware, software, technical and education limitations.
                                  As we were working with time constraints, Shane applied his technical knowledge in sourcing the hardware and software to operate the device, including the communication protocol for relaying data to the analytical software.
                                  The rest of the group were assigned tasks to research the capabilities of the hardware and software as well as self-education in the programming languages that were to be used.
                                  Data communication would be handled by Wi-Fi, which is used for Wireless Local Area Networks and Internet services. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) will be developed in Qt Designer.
                                  The use of Arduino, an open-source electronics software platform, that allows communication between the electronic hardware by receiving output from the sensors to operate the functions, its programmed to perform.
                                  The chosen programming language for the GUI and server side is Python. The code will be developed by Shane in PyCharm, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), by JetBrains.
                                  We chose Python because of its ease of use and features it offered and was suitable for our project. Shane will program the Arduino using the C programming language.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-0 mt-2 display-7"><strong>Goal 3. </strong></h5>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                                  Each group member was allocated a task that was created in Microsoft Teams, under the task tab.
                                  The tasks were created as theory-based writing, documented in Microsoft Word, reinforcing the technology that was going to be used and fortifying the foundation of the project in written form.
                                  This was for presentation to potential customers and legal documentation of the project’s creation and existence.
                                  Our strengths were considered to make the overall decision as we have experience from many different fields of work.
                                  Collaboration was carried out on the areas that required group input, however any member that was experiencing difficulties, would be assisted.
                                  Our team had unique attributes and rarely did we see the need to require assistance other than the technical aspects of the device as some components were above our knowledge threshold and given the time frame to learn such intricacies were limited.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-0 mt-2 display-7"><strong>Goal 4. </strong></h5>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                                  Our group held a video conference each week on Thursday 8pm and Sunday 4pm AEST (Australian Eastern Standard Time).
                                  This was a progress update and report of the tasks set out from Microsoft Teams.
                                  Every member would express their thoughts, ideas, and difficulties they encountered during the process.
                                  We assisted each other with opinions from an educational and personal standpoint to assist any group member.
                                  All meetings were documented and an accounted for with Agendas and Notes taken, then posted in the Microsoft Teams wall post.
                                  This allowed everyone to remain updated on the latest file creations and version updates, as well as lifestyle changes.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-0 mt-2 display-7"><strong>Goal 5. </strong></h5>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                                  A prototype of the device as seen in the Tools and Tech page of our (Project Ideas) Website was created. This gave us a 2D/3D model view of the hardware realised.
                                  This was Shane’s speciality and deciphered well ahead of schedule due to the known time constraints.
                                  The planning and progress that went into this was phenomenal and an attest to the skill and backed up by the group’s motivation and drive, saw us succeed by assisting one another based on our individual strengths.
                                  We decided to call our device “PulseBeat”, after the features that it offers.
                                  The ability to monitor the pulse to calculate heart beat rhythmical patterns, blood rate oxygen levels and if the patient has collapsed.
                                  The device could be worn of a part of the body that detects the human pulse.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-0 mt-2 display-7"><strong>Goal 6. </strong></h5>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                                  The GUI (Graphical User Interface) was created in Qt Designer. This was then converted into Python code for PyCharm to interpret the GUI into a working visual presentation.
                                  Our goal here was to take the static model of Qt Designer and forge it into a representation of what the medical personnel can visually understand and document.
                                  We implemented a new feature in this stage called Man-Down. If a patient’s heart rate dips below a certain level, an alarm will be triggered and sent out to medical personnel as data for them to analyse the situation.
                                  This is achieved by utilising an Arduino with an Accelerometer, connected to a heart rate sensor.
                                  This will measure the force of acceleration and positioning of the body to calculate whether the patient has suffered an attack, be it heart related or alternate source.
                                </p>
                                <h5 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-0 mt-2 display-7"><strong>Goal 7. </strong></h5>
                                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                                  Testing the communication variant of our device is particularly important to us. It shows that we have a working prototype to showcase to our customers.
                                  Any programming bugs, hardware or software errors will be addressed by troubleshooting the issue.
                                  It will be done in this stage to ensure all features are working as they should, and the device is transmitting data in a controlled environment to simulate a professional one.

                                  As with many projects, whether funded or unfunded, issues do sometimes arise. We plan to do as much as possible in the given time frame that we have been allocated.
                                  As a team and we think that we have achieved the best possible results based on that.
                                  The most important parts of the project are that we attained a working replica of the device that addresses many issues that the traditional Holter Monitor poses.
                                  We have gathered all the necessary information to deem the project as feasible as we can, based on our statistical findings and research, with experience from a group member in the field as well as competitive products in the consumer market.
                                  Another important part of the project is the technical aspects to showcase our device in its infancy as a Beta release, provided we have worked out the bugs.
                                  Our priorities are in the creation of “PulseBeat”, as we believe that it has the potential to be something significant and an interest to the medical industry.
                                  However, if we were to choose an aspect that should have priority over the rest, it would be the documentation of the device, explaining how the technology functions with respect to the details.

                                  As mentioned, we were working with constraints to implement a working model and used the time as effectively as we could to achieve our goal.
                                  If we only had enough time or resources for one of our goals, we would allocate it to Research and Development.
                                  This is an important area where a vision is sometimes too complex and complicated for a team to achieve based on overall experience within the industry.
                                  These skills take time to enhance, and we must consider these limitations as well. Without proper planning and an intricate thought process, it would be building a project with a means to no end.

                                  We decided that we would have group meeting twice per week. We took turns scheduling and hosting the meetings.
                                  Each meeting was done via video chat on MS Teams. We would also use MS Teams to chat in a group forum in between meetings.
                                  Fortunately, we haven’t had any issues with team members not responding to chats, not attending meetings, etc.
                                  However, if this did occur, we would have sought help from our tutors immediately.

                                  RDS’s goal is to devise and develop a wearable medical device that can transmit vital signs of a patient, via WIFI, to be remotely monitored by medical staff.
                                   This enables medical staff to act upon a medical emergency if the patient is in danger, even if the patient is unaware.

                                  To develop this device will require a multitude of steps and goals to be achieved on a regular basis.
                                  These steps will be broken down into smaller, more manageable steps and goals. This will help our team have clear, achievable goals each week and stop us from feeling overwhelmed.

                                  Development of the firmware/hardware was performed by the Lead Software Developer. Research of the hardware/software tools was performed by our Lead Research team member.
                                  We chose to use the [1] ESP8266 and the Maxim heartrate sensor for its ease of use, cost, documentation, and availability.
                                  The Arduino community have already designed this type of sensor/WiFi project before.
                                  This was another advantage for us to use this hardware as we could borrow some of the ideas the community used and implement it on our project.
                                  This saves time and effort to produce a working model.

                                  Hardware development was simple and required a connection from the oximeter to the ESP8266. This was in the form of a I2C serial interface and power connections.
                                  The power to the ESP8266 is from the USB programming cable from the PC however, this device is intended to be powered from a battery.

                                  To initialise the WiFi, serial communications and oximeter, the following code snippet was used.
                                  We used the examples in the Arduino IDE for this section of code to save time as writing the code from scratch would have been a difficult and time-consuming task.

                                  The main (while 1 loop) section of the code (below diagram) polls the sensor, converts the value to beats per minute and connects to the simple Python server to transfer sensor data.
                                  The code works reasonably well however, when the client side is connecting to the server, there can be a delay of about 3 seconds.
                                  In that connection time, there is no sensor conversion or data collection as the connection to the server blocks its task.
                                  A timer interrupt and interrupt service routine to collect data from the sensor needs to be implemented as the sensor data is the most important data to be collected and converted.

                                  A more generic/common IP address needs to be implemented.

                                  The sensor is cheap and at $8.00, would not be suitable for a commercial application. Searching the Arduino forums, others are experiencing similar problems with device.

                                The below diagram is PyCharm IDE running a simple socket server bound to the PC WiFi interface.
                                The second window that is displaying GET DATA(x,x,x,x) is the data from the ESP8266 which includes the heartrate, MAC address, RSSI and Boolean for finger detection.
                                The data is in the form of a CSV, can be split up and sent to each section of the Python QT GUI. We had issues, initially with the data = socket.recv(1024) data buffer.
                                The data buffer needs to be completely emptied before other tasks would continue, it blocked the flow of data from the ESP8266.
                                This was undesirable. Our intentions where for the data flow from the ESP8266 to be a constant stream that is feed to the GUI for continual updates.
                                After some research we discovered a Python module called [2] Select. The Select allowed efficient I/O from the WiFi interface to constantly stream the data from the ESP8266.
                                The code for Select was derived from the Select module online documentation example.

                                The UI/GUI development started with [3] QT Designer in a drag and drop development environment for quick and easy GUI layout.
                                 This is an open-source software package and is free to download. Below is a snapshot of the development in progress.
                                 It was extremely easy to use and somewhat intuitive. To design our simple GUI took less than 1 hour.
                                 The conversion to Python code was not so simple.
                                 </p>

                                 There were some issues creating the .py Python files from QT Designer XML files. We had to find the pyuic5.exe, create a folder, save all the QT Designer files to it and then run pyuic5.exe in the folder to create the Python code.
                                 This had to be done on the command line as there is no click and convert feature in this IDE.
                                 It is quite clunky for a supported and popular GUI IDE. We may automate this process with Python in future iterations.

                                 The GUI Python file is now a .py file that can be edited in PyCharm IDE.
                                 Our assumption was that the GUI update will be in the main thread and to run other tasks will require some sort of worker thread to take care of the socket server, data manipulation and data collection from ESP8266 for display on the GUI.
                                 Using simple threading is not possible as the main thread is the GUI, and other more taxing worker threads will block the update of the GUI and make the user experience unpleasant.
                                   <br/><br/>
                                   With a little research we decided to use the [4] QThread module which is suited to this application and is a recommendation for PyQt5 GUI threading.
                                   This module allows send and emit signals between worker threads and the main thread. This helps with control of the threading time slots and avoids the GUI hanging or responding slowly.
                                   Below is the application running and a worker thread with a while 1 loop that constantly prints to the console/command line.

                                   As you can see the GUI is visible, populated and the worker thread is printing to the console/command line.
                                   This worker thread is where the server and data collection will be executed, and variables will be written to the GUI.

                                   The GUI will have a maximum and minimum heartrate limit that can be set by the user.
                                   When these limits are reached, ‘Emergency’ will be displayed on the GUI.
                                   If the software detects that the patient’s finger is not on the sensor, the GUI will then display “No Finger” in red text, however, ‘Emergency’ will not be displayed.

                                  Integration of the GUI and the socket server will need to be implemented.
                                  The socket server will reside in the worker thread as it constantly needs to be receiving data from the ESP8266 client and updating the GUI.
                                  The program will be one Python file only and not split up into other files such as GUI, server, worker thread.
                                  The reason for this is to produce a quick and dirty prototype without dependencies.
                                  If this was developed as a commercial product, we would spend the time and effort to plan the GUI and other aspects of the PC application with careful consideration.
                                  A professional installation package would also be designed for ease of installation and to ensure proper setup of Windows environment for supporting our application.
                                  For this application, an executable file will be developed. The integration of the various code fragments wasn’t too difficult.
                                  Careful planning where the code fragments go and how to implement was a simple logic process.

                                  The RSSI only serves the purpose of an indication for the operator to identify if the device is out of range for quality heartrate data.
                                  This RSSI indication would change colour to red if the patient was out of range.

                                    There are some non-functioning aspects of the GUI that we didn’t have time to develop such as the time of arrival text and information.
                                    Only one device can be displayed on the GUI when the server can take up to 10 connections from individual devices.
                                    The RSSI level would turn red if the patient was out of range.
                                    The MAC address of the device is meaningless to the operator, and we would have liked to associate the MAC address with a patient’s name instead.
                                    Easier for the operator to understand. The emergency alarm and flashing screen is one function that needs to implemented however, we have unfortunately, run out of time.
